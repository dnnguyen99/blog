I am a machine learning/data scientist with a deep appreciation for the mathematical concepts that underlie machine learning techniques. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a passion for using data and modeling to help solve problems and make the world a better place. My ultimate goal is to use data and machine learning techniques to make a positive impact on people's lives.
