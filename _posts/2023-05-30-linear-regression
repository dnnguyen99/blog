## What is Multiple Linear Regression?
Linear regression is a machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a quantitative response variable and one or more predictors. The goal is to find a linear model that captures the relationship between the independent (predictor) variables and the dependent (response) variable. This model can then be used to predict new, unseen data. When there are multiple predictors involved, we use the term "multiple linear regression" to denote the extension of simple linear regression to accommodate more than one predictor variable. 

For example, there might be a linear relationship between a person's age and their height and weight. We can fit a linear regression model using the available age, height, and weight data to capture this relationship. Then, the response (denoted as \\(y\\)) will be the age we try to predict. 
There are two predictors: height (denoted as \\(X^{(1)}\\)) and weight (denoted as \\(X^{(2)}\\)). Linear regression uses a linear equation with coefficients \\(\beta\\) to capture the relationship between the predictors 
and the response:

  $$age = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (Height) + \beta_2 (Weight) \text{ or }$$
