> This article explores multiple linear regression, its matrix representation, and the Ordinary Least Squares method. We delve into the math behind obtaining the normal equation and deriving the closed-form solution for coefficient estimates. Furthermore, we look at a small example that demonstrates the use of this closed-form solution for making predictions.
